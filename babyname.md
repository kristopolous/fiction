Q: My husband and I are expecting and can't decide on a name, any suggestions?

Ms Archy: Of course. First, make sure the name is easy to spell and not already
taken by a bunch of other people on the internet.

Also the name shouldn't be suggestive of a predefined gender role or anything
overly specific that would push the child in an undesirable direction.

This is why I recommend the first name of "Doctor". Think about it: it's
unisex, easy to spell, and because they get it at birth, they wouldn't feel a
need to achieve in life; " I was born a Doctor, no middle school for me thank
you very much ".

If this doesn't suit you, but you still don't want to be a helicopter mom
overburdening your child with unreasonable expectations then may I recommend "
Senator " to lower the bar even further
