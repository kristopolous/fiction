Being Elvis started on the tarmac. I felt like a costumed character at Disneyland perparing for it as I landed. 
Clothes covered in rhinestones are uncomfortable and heavy. I can't really map the evolution of how it became
expected of me but without it, I'm just Aaron from Mississippi.  Most people don't have to put on their work 
clothes to get off an airplane.

I always peered out the window to see what kind of crowd I had to respond to. Most of the time airport security
did it's job but other times, the security was waiting for autographs with a bunch of screaming young women. This
was one of those times.

Those girls were always nicely dressed with their whole lives ahead of them. Some of the smartest people I met
were women. I wish they were in a place where they were making their own decisions but they probably aren't. 
How many Helen Kellers have we lost because of society's deaf and blindness?

I guess my only job here was to make them happy. For them to see Elvis, I must be Elvis. The plane landed and I
see the stairs roll up to the door. Their hands are up with records and magazines hoping that I'll sign.
