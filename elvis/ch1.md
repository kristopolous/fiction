I wanted to be famous like Johnnie Ray and Perry Como. 

It felt exciting.  I could imagine Perry sitting in his car, his song "If" comes on the radio, the disc jockey says 'and now the song you've all been waiting for'.  I can imagine the most excited person to hear it would be Perry himself.

"For the next 3 minutes I am this station." he'd say as he drove that expensive car.

As a teenager I was so far from that reality I didn't know how to dream it. sitting in my parents house flipping their radio between KWEM and WDIA, two of the music stations in Memphis in those days, ...

Where I was living, there were really 3 big kinds of music: the ballads and gospel, the blues, and hillbilly music. Normally these groups stayed clear of each other. 

I thought about bringing their styles together because honestly I couldn't decide which path to take. I had no idea what I was doing or what I was getting into. That was my holding pattern for decades: today is good enough and tomorrow will be fine as well.

I think you fall into fame. You think you are reaching for it and getting closer but it's all an illusion. Fame isn't that thing you can see in front of you, it's what you can trip over trying to get there. You fall to the ground and look around, shrug your shoulders and say "I guess I've arrived".

It's a trap. The magic thing about traps are that you don't realize you're in one until you try to leave.

The journey is the goal but only if you keep going and my motion is what gave it meaning.
