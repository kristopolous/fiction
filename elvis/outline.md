Pitch:

Elvis becomes disillusioned with fame
He seeks to find other realities to experience
He tries mod subculture, there's something too foreign and too european about it. Although he is welcome as a celebrity he finds himself to be an outsider, never really connecting or experiencing with them, just around them, like some sociologist studying a tribe.
The psychedelic surge around 1967 interests him. It was something that was beyond him. He had hybridized everything in the 1950s to create his form of rock, this was another thing that he could latch on to.
However, he didn't want this to be part of his public persona. He felt for the first time, that there was a non-publicly available side of himself. There was a private elvis.`
He tries LSD, mescalin, peyote, marijuana, all the things he can get his hands on. Privately he's forming new friends. He stops using the name elvis. These people, they know who elvis is, sure. They don't care though, and frankly, he doesn't either.
Meanwhile his public life is locked in time. He continues to make public appearances as the man he once was. But he feels increasingly disconnected from the stage presence and the personal 
His managers and his record companies equivocate hippy culture to a bunch of "fags and floozies" and says it'll hurt his image, hurt his fans, who have come to rely on an elvis they know.
He thinks "As an artist, I need to be a fraud for the protection, the comfort of others." how can he compromise his soul and yet still be him. He thinks it's a cardboard cutout with a pulse that goes up on that stage.
He starts to plan his escape. A very elaborate phony death could be possible. He knows he'd never want to come back. Not to his wife, not to his former friends, he wasn't with them anymore.  The same feeling he had in the 1960s in the mod culture, surrounded by foreign european sensibilities he felt again.
Instead of popping amphetamines, they were smoking and drinking the nights away. A life that was just a bunch of strung-together wreckless las vegas blackouts. 
By this time he had found out about organics and the natural foods movement. He would just be ordering water and watch his friends get sloshed at night wishing he was anywhere else, just not there.
After reading the Casteneda books he was mezmerized with the idea of escaping to mexico - a rural village with no television reception. A place where you may find an elvis record but probably no device to listen to it with.
He could collect his thoughts, be with nobody but himself for a while, and then find out where to go from there.

--- the pilot says he'll return in 90 days.

12 hour ago I was at a night club in las vegas. Now here I am, it's early morning and I'm surrounded by a forest in mexico. As the plane lifts off the ground I think back to bhagavad gita 15.7, "The embodied souls in this material world are My eternal fragmental parts. But bound by material nature, they are struggling...". I am just as alone as I was yesterday but now it's no longer just a feeling, it's a wonderful, beautiful reality.  "...struggling very hard with the six senses, including the mind". I can hear and taste the now. Life has never felt this real.  As the plane sweeps over the horizon off into the distance, I turn around, I see the single suitcase, the water canteen, and the man waiting in the truck for me to get in. 

Today is the first day of my life. Finally, I can see the perpetual now that Watts talked about and finally, I know it is actually there.


--- I think it should end here - in the 1970s, and talk about a second volume that he intends to write and maybe, perhaps, it will be as cathartic as the first to write.
