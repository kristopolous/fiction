Elvis becomes disillusioned with fame
He seeks to find other realities to experience
He tries mod subculture, there's something too foreign and too european about it. Although he is welcome as a celebrity he finds himself to be an outsider, never really connecting or experiencing with them, just around them, like some sociologist studying a tribe.
The psychedelic surge around 1967 interests him. It was something that was beyond him. He had hybridized everything in the 1950s to create his form of rock, this was another thing that he could latch on to.
However, he didn't want this to be part of his public persona. He felt for the first time, that there was a non-publicly available side of himself. There was a private elvis.`
He tries LSD, mescalin, peyote, marijuana, all the things he can get his hands on. Privately he's forming new friends. He stops using the name elvis. These people, they know who elvis is, sure. They don't care though, and frankly, he doesn't either.
Meanwhile his public life is locked in time. He continues to make public appearances as the man he once was. But he feels increasingly disconnected from the stage presence and the personal 
His managers and his record companies equivocate hippy culture to a bunch of "fags and floozies" and says it'll hurt his image, hurt his fans, who have come to rely on an elvis they know.
He thinks "As an artist, I need to be a fraud for the protection, the comfort of others." how can he compromise his soul and yet still be him. He thinks it's a cardboard cutout with a pulse that goes up on that stage.
He starts to plan his escape. A very elaborate phony death could be possible. He knows he'd never want to come back. Not to his wife, not to his former friends, he wasn't with them anymore.  The same feeling he had in the 1960s in the mod culture, surrounded by foreign european sensibilities he felt again.
Instead of popping amphetamines, they were smoking and drinking the nights away. A life that was just a bunch of strung-together wreckless las vegas blackouts. 
By this time he had found out about organics and the natural foods movement. He would just be ordering water and watch his friends get sloshed at night wishing he was anywhere else, just not there.
After reading the Casteneda books he was mezmerized with the idea of escaping to mexico - a rural village with no television reception. A place where you may find an elvis record but probably no device to listen to it with.
He could collect his thoughts, be with nobody but himself for a while, and then find out where to go from there.
--- plan of escape

Could I leave them all? I've already left Priscilla. I'd be leaving them with millions of dollars, I'm sure they'd manage. Is that really abandonment? Colonel Parker onces told me the most profitable career move a star could make is to kill themselves. Valens died at 17. I'll be gone at 2 1/2 times that. Long enough. 

It's either that or a disco record. I swear, the phone calls and meetings about it are endless. A bunch of fairies doing coke. They think drafting us into the disco is going to work. They talked to me, Paul McCartney, Roger Waters, trying to cash in on the craze. Who's next on their list? Miles Davis? I'm sure they'd pay that fairy James Baldwin to write the lyrics.

There I go again. These are my erroneous zones. Those thoughts help nobody. Brooding over time wasted is more wasted time. Nothing that I value will come from those types of patterns or that way of thinking. Do things people will want to remember and not those they'll try to forget.

Although honestly, no disco.

"What would you do with say $2,000?" I asked him. He thought for a moment and responded "Pay back my sister. I've borrowed about
$1500 from her over the years. That's a lot of money. She can't afford it and she's got a kid. That's really all I want to do."

There's hundreds of people impersonating Elvis better than I can. It works better if my version of Elvis finally leaves the building.

    Dear Frances, 

    45 years is a long time to fail. The best years are now behind me.
    Everyone builds a nest. Some of thems are castles and others are merely 
    dirt. 

    I don't look upon my burdensome years with aspirations and intend to 
    commit myself to a final regret. It will be tidy.

    I've enclosed $2,000, this should cover everything and then some. 

    Try to remember our smiles.

    Sincerely,
    Edward


"You get to die as Elvis and I give your sister a better life." as he pens his 

Will Ginger find out? Well it's not like she's going to find me. It's important to make sure everyone around me
barely knows me at all. That's the only way I can dissappear out in the open like this.

--- a dead elvis impersonator just by luck?

I figured my final time as Elvis should be spent with a fan because my gilded husk sill shines for some. 

I'm still preoccupied with living vicariously through other's fickle acceptance. The impermanence of amusement and the increasing encompassing nature of it all. We drown ourselves, asphixiating, in our pasttimes, just like that Stevie Wonder song. We can't consume something without that something also consuming us and that's why it is so crucial to exercise agency in that choice.

We get an impersonator to join me and than some young girl to find him dead while I'm already gone.

I have to admit, I kind of liked Ginger and under other conditions, one of which includes me being 20 years younger, it might have worked out.
In her I saw everything I had lost but nothing I had gained with age.

Aligning everythig with a tour was pretty brilliant. Everything is packed and ready to go. 

--- final night
--- his slipaway

--- an airport in the mountains of sonora
--- the pilot says he'll return in 90 days.

12 hour ago I was at the Las Vegas Hilton in some polyester suit with plastic rhinestones singing to a bunch of people on their honeymoons. Now here I am, the sun is cracking over a large mountain range. It's an early crisp august morning and I'm surrounded by nature in Mexico. The plane's propellers start rotating and I hear the engines as my friend waves at me and yells "remember, 90 days".

I smile and wave back. But there was something different. That smile, it came from happiness. The waving back, came from warmth and excitement. There was substance behind the form.

As the plane rolls down the runway and lifts off the ground I think back to Bhagavad Gita 15.7, "The embodied souls in this material world are My eternal fragmental parts. But bound by material nature, they are struggling...". I am just as alone as I was yesterday but now it's no longer just a feeling, it's a wonderful, beautiful reality.  "...struggling very hard with the six senses, including the mind". I can hear, smell, and taste today, as if it is something that I've never experienced. Life has never felt this real. As the plane sweeps over the horizon off into the distance, I turn around and see the suitcase, water canteen, and the man waiting in the truck for me to get in. 

Today is the first day of my life. Finally, I can see the perpetual now that Watts told me about and finally, I know it is actually there.


--- I think it should end here - in the 1970s, and talk about a second volume that he intends to write and maybe, perhaps, it will be as cathartic as the first to write.
