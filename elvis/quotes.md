When I look around the tables I see all the gamblers spending their days here. Gambling is a sick joke played on people with more time than money. And these drunk fools are the people who value neither.

These military men in front of me had found something they valued worth dying for. I had still not found anything in my life worth living for. It was like television was unfolding all around me. Somehow I was the passive observer without agency.  I mean I had it, I knew I did, but if the desire to instrument it is absent it's like having a box full of tools you never use.

My future felt like an inevitably futile series of failed negotiations with a constantly increasing past. I was uncorked early and what's left in my bottle is stale and bitter.

Besides, what pop star is big in their 40s? Hell, George Gershwim and Mozart didn't see 40. I'm just tired reruns.
