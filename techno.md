I had a conversation tonight about my first exposure to techno.

This was mid 90s, there was no YouTube or even Napster. I only knew what was on
TV and radio. I actually didn't really like music that much. Music to me was
Coolio and Soundgarden, fine, but not very interesting really. Uncreative,
repetitive, gimmicky.

Then one day, around 1996, I found this show on KCRW and this song came on

"EVERYTHING EVERYTHING EVERY EVERYTHING EVERYTHING EVERY, I'M INVISIBLE, I'M
INVISIBLE"

and I was like "what on Earth is this?!"

I kept listening, the song was crazy, never heard anything like that before.
After it was over some people started talking on the radio.

This is what they said

"What were the skies like when you were young?
They went on forever and they, when I, we lived in Arizona
And the skies always had little fluffy clouds"

And there was ANOTHER crazy sounding song. What was the world hiding from me?
What could i find on my little radio?

I remember going to the library, shuffling through CDs for loan, looking for
this new sound. It was stuff like REO Speedwagon and Yes! "No, this is not
right"

I realized from there on out, I had to trailblaze my own path, nothing in front
of me would do.
