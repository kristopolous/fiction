During the 1700s, a cabal from the burgeoning capitalist class raised a
mercenary to raid the coffers of the local fuedal lords. After doorbusting
their castles, they plundered all they could see and peddled the stolen
valuables in the town square at bargain rates causing a buying frenzy.

The fuedal lords were incensed and used their militia armed with muskets to
fight against the mercenary with their blunderbusses causing the streets to
become black with soot and gunpowder.

The townspeople fled wearing their new cheaply bought prussian silk robes and
carrying knapsacks containing fine ming chinaware shouting "be a libertine, on
dollar a day, frugality"

The capitalists made off like bandits, because they were, the townspeople were
busy enjoying their new things, the town was upended and covered in soot, and
the fuedal lords saw the writing on the wall.

This was the first Black Friday.
