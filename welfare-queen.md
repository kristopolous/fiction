I love the idea of a welfare queen.

queen: I'm about $90 short every month!
person: Maybe you could work an extra hour or two a week or cut back on some
small expense...
queen: I could, but I have another plan! I'm going to go through 9 months of
pregnancy, then child-birth, then raise the child, be a full-time mother, take
them to school, soccer practice, and attend to their needs and then, now get
this, here's the scam, I'll get the government to just *give* me $90 a month!
person: What a brilliant idea. All you need is pregnancy, child-birth, and a
lifetime of being a dedicated mother. Heck, you should do this 5... no no, 6
times! I can't imagine raising a child costs that much, right? I mean look at
it, $90 free big ones, just sitting for the taking!
queen: Yah, imagine it! $540 a month and all I have to do is raise 6 children!
Easy-peasy!
person: Thanks to those foolish liberals just handing out checks. What dupes!
queen: Yeah, who needs to work for $1080 a year when you can just raise a child
instead! I'll call the first one my Benjamin Baby! Suuuuckers!
