I think spiders are some of the strangest animals out there.

"Spiders?!" You say in disbelief.

Imagine if, instead of spiders being everywhere they were so rare that a remote
explorer spelunking through a cave had just discovered them.

"At first I was amazed at this sticky moss that seemed to grow only at night.
But then upon closer observation I noticed some of it had a distinct geometric
structure with a small creature perched in the center. The next night I
carefully observed one of these creatures painstakingly weave this elaborate
spiraling structure, many times their size, go to the center and wait.
Occasionally a flying insect came by and got caught in the creature's trap! The
tiny nimble thing went over and killed it likely with some kind of venom and
feasted by sucking it from the inside out. Horrific!"
