Introduction

On August 16, 1977 Elvis died but I did not. 

Let's go back 2 years. I was at the Las Vegas Hilton in 1975 on a Saturday night singing Heartbreak hotel and I stopped midway through the song. I realized I made it half my life ago. Half my life had passed by and I was singing the same song. I left the stage. I locked myself in my dressing room. I sobbed. I didn't leave for 3 days.

My manager said I was ill. He couldn't have been more right. I'd rather be the king with no clothes than the same ones for the next 40 years. I had to plan an escape.

It was really around 1970 it all started. I was turning down gigs. Acting mostly. I never could act. I knew it, everyone did. But they wanted me in front of that damn camera. A "loon who thinks he's elvis" on the bob newhart show - a special guest appearance on the mary tyler moore show; I couldn't do any of that. I wouldn't. I didn't.

It wasn't about the money - there's nothing cheaper and more degrading than working for money.

Then Janice died. First Mr. Coltrane, then Jimmy and now Janice. I wanted to die more than any of them. I was surviving for a reason and I had to find out what that was.

Maybe it wasn't that I was living for an undiscovered reason in as much as I hadn't found any good enough reason to die yet. 

Could Elvis die without me?

I thought I couldn't begin to tell you what it felt like to have these thoughts haunt you for 5 years bubbling up before that breakdown in 1975. 

It took me 35 years to put those thoughts together and hopefully I can express them adequately in the following pages.

If not for you, then for myself. I need this as a way to replay my thoughts. Please indulge me as I lose myself to liberate myself. 

Also, please excuse my writing. I'm a teen idol in my 70s. The only thing I was ever good at was singing.   

And you'll always have my records. Feel free to play them as you read along if you must. But I assure you that Elvis is dead. I killed him.
