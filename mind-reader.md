the grand opening of the new skyscraper. i was invited to the penthouse deck
after watching the ribbon being cut. i could see the city from my 40 story
vantage point - buildings and cars glisten in the distance.

I went into the bathroom where i had to peel the plastic coating from the new
urinal which had probably just been installed the night before. And as I went
to the sink to wash up, I realized that I had known exactly where the bathroom
was.

I had been there before. I went out trying to test this. I predicted places I
hadn't seen: "The next room has a red leather couch on the right, a Native
American rug, and a mid-century table - the rug has a terrible stain on it."

I walked in and saw one of the local socialites turn a bit too quickly and the
champagne glass leave her fingers, falling on a new Native American rug
staining it in the exact place I had remembered.

That was the first day I realized, on that deck, that I remembered the past and
the future but unfortunately had no way of telling which was which.
