I initially came here to test out the mythical jeweled Tigmamanukan statue I confiscated from the ancient ruined city of Paititi which is rumored to have magical powers.

According to a story I was told in Cairo, I need to orient the creature with the amulet on its head facing northwest, in a "Plane of no sound, where the wind bears west over red canyons of white phosphorous stripes" Then "During the rise of Aquarius, seven black-throated sparrows, flying in the shape of a tetrahedron, will crow three times. The statue will come to life and grant you a wish".

As you can imagine, it took forever to find the place! I searched for years, driving to different canyons and crawling the internet trying to find the promised canyon.  But this, place, in Moab Utah, this is the place. I am certain.

Ok, so there I am, at like 7am, freezing myself in late January, with the statue in the canyon. Hoping no loud cars are going to come by, all of a sudden, these tiny birds come out over the horizon, 3 at first, then 4, then finally 7, bearing a formation like the thunderbirds stunt planes - it is startling. Their synchronization is remarkable.  Every wingflap happens at the same time.  In chorus unisom, I hear a single caw, followed by two more; at increasing pitches - the last one, nearly ear shattering.

The ground quakes and shakes. The statue knocks over falling to the sand.  I run to catch it but I am too late.  It melts away, losing all form, to a puddle of black tar.

Everything is now deafeningly silent; the birds have all disappeared. A slight breeze picks up and subsides.  I stared at the tar in shock of what just happened.  But to my amazement, it starts to move as if alive!

I reel in horror at the spectacle of the pool of blackness slowly taking shape and form - like a rising phoenix. I slowly see wings forming and what looks like a birds head - on a magnificent creature I had never seen.

The blackness of the tar gives away to a bright agate body with tapestried wings colored like jasper. The eyes are like the finest emeralds. And then the beak, which appears like that of a sapphire stone, slowly opens, and the bird eloquently speaks in a deep booming voice, "Evaru nannu cetana cesindi. Nenu dhan'yavadalu. Mi korika emiti?".  It spoke!

But what the hell does "Evaru" mean? I find some air to gasp "Do you speak english".  It just comes back at me with more gibberish. "oday youyay eakspay englishyay?" I say, but to no avail.

My phone has no reception so I can't try to translate the mysterious utterances. We stare blankly at each other, knowing that I am certainly not going to get my end of the bargain. I don't know what to do.  I am cold.  I think I wet my pants during the earthquake.  Things are getting awkward.

I rise my hands, thinking I can try to gesture to the bird in some universal signage language, but right when I rise my hands towards the creature, I distantly see some bird coming out of the horizon.

It's the seven birds from before, this time flying backwards in the same formation! They approach at rapid pace and crow backwards, like a reversed tape, in decreasing pitch.  After the third crow, all birds vanish in a bright flash and the statue returns to where it started.

Everything falls silent, and I see a jackrabbit pass in front of me, totally unaware of what just happened.

So yeah, it was a pretty cool place.
