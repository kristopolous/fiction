when i was a kid my school had these christmas shows where everyone had to
sing.

every year i sang and every year my parents didn't believe me. 'you don't open
your mouth up', 'i didn't hear you'.

when i was about 11 i had enough of my parents bogus complaints so i just
opened and closed my mouth in huge wide gaps, like a fish - singing absolutely
nothing.

"i could finally hear you!" they chirped. "Isn't it nice to participate" they
exclaimed.

I didn't actually sing anything. All they wanted was to see me open and close
my jaw in some hugely exaggerated manner.

So every year after that I just stood there, opening and closing my mouth as
wide as possible.

I hated those things.
