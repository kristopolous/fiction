You may think it's a delight
to go bump in the night
and give neighbors a fright

But it's hard work to lurk
and make people berserk

I plan for days to scare
but most find it funny
they don't even beware

I visit them in dreams
to give them a scream
but they say I'm not scary
Or I'm just imaginary!

I wish it worked out
I wish I could spook
see them scream and run
not turning back to look

I tried every trick
I broke every rule
All I did was look like a fool

Just the other day
I heard my friend, the zombie say,
"Brainns...Well there he goes again, that retched louse
I heard he couldn't even scare a mouse"

oh well.

"Not everyone's a ghoul," they say
So I went back to school
to study all day

Now I'm no longer out late
I'm at home instead, asleep by 8.
No hiding under beds
I'm the sleepy head

The future's mine to create
It'll all be alright.
Oh no, it's a quarter past 8,
I bid you goodnight!
