I'd like to hear a story of a date rape by a hopeless romantic: You wake up in
a luxury hotel suite with a bouquet of flowers and box of chocolates to the
sound of room service delivering breakfast.

You stumble down to the lobby, still dizzy and confused when you realize you're
wearing an unfamiliar custom tailored designer coat in colors that match your
eyes. The high end material rumples softly. As you're about to call an uber,
there's a sign with your name on it - a chartered limo is waiting to take you
home.

You never get a story or find out what happened.

A week later you're walking by L'endroit Cher, a $500/plate French Restaurant
you'd have to be rich and famous to go to and the man in front says "Bonne
aprÃ¨s-midi! It is so nice to see you again! Please, come back any time."

You stare at the unfamiliar face and realize memories are merely exercises we
do to process the world. The world works mostly the same if yours aren't there,
almost as if it's all scripted theater. The only difference is that things
happen to you, not with you. You lose the agency of your own reality.

Knowing what happened you thought was a necessary experience of the human
condition, a crucial supporting pillar of sanity. "Do all realities need to be
tied to the past through tidy narratives?" you ask yourself...

Do these causality holes enable discontinuous leaps? A few hour gap in your
life's story and you wake up almost as if you've lost your identity when a
couple pages went missing. Is that finally the way to change things?

The biggest transformations seem to start without your awareness. They only
happen if you embrace the darkness.
