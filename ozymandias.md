A cryonically preserved person gets revived in 5,000,000 years by an
achaelogist who stumbles on the capsule in a mountain cave.

The 21st century person is an Ãƒ<U+0096>tzi - eager scientists of a future evolutionary
state study how the primitive homosapien moves his limbs and carefully records
sleeping and dietary habits in a controlled lab - trying to crack the cryptic
ancient English language they have no fossil record of.

The team wins awards and counts their blessing the specimen had an easily
reversible cancer.

"They gave me the tower-of-hanoi problem today - but these people, these
things, expected the stacks to be upside down. "Obvious" things, as it turns
out, are mere cultural vestiges.

The sole thing making me relevant is that nothing left has any relevance to me.
They even record my mumblings when I sleep - carefully archiving them and
sharing them with distinguished researchers from far off lands.

Every day I'm defining an era - a living specimen of the urban stratum. What a
discovery!

Everything I do will become the new normal, the new average ... there is no
other baseline - only me, and what I do. I am the God of history. I am,
Ozymandias."
