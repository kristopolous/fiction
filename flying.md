You hate the airport because it's unavoidable mainstream corporate culture.

There you are, sitting in essentially a giant shopping mall with a couple of
airplanes, pop music in the background, advertising screens everywhere telling
you how ugly you are, the smell of chain restaurants and lousy coffee,
surrounded by normies who work for corporate America and live in the suburbs.

That's why you hate airports. You worked so hard to insulate yourself from
America but here you are, having to fucking deal with it.

Then you get on the plane and that fantasy you have, that most people read
books, have conversations, don't *really* watch television, and actually are
quite competent, this illusion, completely shattered. They glug down their
sodas and fall asleep in front of a little television watching some jingoistic
movie talking about how unimaginably great, necessary and noble authority
figures are and drool on themselves.

Splendid. At least they are mostly polite and orderly...
