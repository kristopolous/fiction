In LA, I've overheard this conversation at coffee shops countless times:

guy 1: So-and-so has a YouTube channel with millions of views. All we gotta do
is make a crappy knockoff and we're in business. I'm a few phone-calls away
from getting a lot of money behind this.

guy 2: That's great! I worked some low-level position in the marketing
department of a boring large corporation for a bit - so I know exactly how to
make things go viral with Facebook mobile tweets in the cloud.

guy 1: Oh awesome. That's perfect. Here's my trite idea for some slapped
together content that will be a mega-hit! First we knockoff yesterday's meme,
then smash it together with other stuff which was never funny. Sounds good
yeah?

guy 2: I don't see how we can lose with this. I've a friend who has made really
terrible websites and doesn't know what he is doing. I'll see if I can get him
on board for free.

guy 1: Sounds great! I'll go home and do absolutely nothing about this. Then
I'll give you a call in a week and pretend like we've moved forward.

guy 2: Perfect. And I'm going to go home and promptly take a nap on my couch.
Then I'll wake up and forget about all of this until your call.

guy 1: Good move. It's been a pleasure to meet you. Here's my card that I
created with the perforated Avery sheets from Office Depot.

guy 2: Thanks. I'll let it sit here in my wallet unused for 4 months, then I'll
trash it. Annnd, here's mine. I look forward to working together!
