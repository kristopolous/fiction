ASK ANN

Dear Ann: I found someone's credit card in the street. What is the proper thing
to do with it?

Ms Archy: The cultural convention when finding a lost credit card is to have a
Parking Meter Jubilee. Take the credit card and put it in every parking meter
on the street.

This is convenient for the credit card companies because then they know that
all charges after the start of the 90 second spout of $43.50 in 23 separate
meter fees are fraudulent and can be dismissed without further investigation.

Normally they have to employ a costly process of expansive investigation. These
jubilee conveniently provides them with a "precipice event" to pivot
legitimacy.

After you are done, place a photograph of both sides of the card at the website
4chan.org/b/. This will insure that the card holder is notified of the lost
card as quickly as possible.
