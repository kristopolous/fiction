I was in a public space today and they were playing the most horrific adult
contemporary station, just absolute garbage. Then I saw this middle-aged white
guy mouthing the words and singing along silently as if he was thinking "omg,
best song ever".

To me, at that moment, his humanity slipped away. In that single act of
delighting in these aurally malodorous corporate entrails he became repulsive
degenerate rubbish.

If at that instant, a giant earthquake violently shook the building and the
room split in two, his side teetering backwards preparing to collapse into an
abyss, with his hand outstretched reaching at me to take a risk to save him,
I'd reflect back at that moment and think "this is a tough reality to grasp,
but the world will be a better place without kelly clarkson fans" as I watch
the opportunity for survival slip away and become enfolded by the calming
silence and serenity of our increasing distance as he is enveloped by the
darkness. "A better tomorrow is upon us all" I'd assure myself.
