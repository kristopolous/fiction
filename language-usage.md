I found this history book from 2534 that a time traveler left. I open it up to
grammar usage:

"in the early 21st century, westerners put cartoonish symbols randomly in their
prose. It didn't really contribute to the content but lived as a literary
garnish, coloring the adjacent content. For instance, to say you had a long
day, we can compare it with the 3 other centuries we've already discussed:

In 2120: Veday be beleagued-nd' bedraggled
In 2020: Fucking spent ð<U+009F><U+0092>¤ð<U+009F><U+0098>´
In 1920: Honestly fagged out to-day.
In 1820: With my energy, which I am intoned upon, and my entire emotional
state, that which I have countenance over, has become enfolded as if by a vile
of enervation, slowly enrapturing my being with solemn lassitudinous gasps as I
drape my limbs upon the fine siamese silks in my chamber, the countless events
of the day dancing like the shadows of Plato's cave, now living only in my
memory to become a play upon which I cannot interrupt and am eternally forced
to attend, forever living past existence through these gorgons of the minds
eye; oh what a wretched day of toil, what a monstrous fright, what contemptuous
morass, never to be lived again but locked away as imprints of the past, a
slumber of spiritual death awaits."

I'll put more excepts later
