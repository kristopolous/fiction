I need to give this a big bloody red 5 stars.

I've heard all these amazing things about this place but as a vegan I was wondering if it was right for me.

I started by making a reservation for 1 on a Friday night simply under the name "Vegan". I arrived promptly on time and my valet had no problem parking my biofuel vanagon.

As I walked into the waiting room the hostess loudly bellowed "VEGAN party of 1" and everyone looked up, just as I had planned! I got up, screamed "Oh yes, that's me!" as I pranced to the hostess who eagerly took me through the dining area (with plates full of animal carcasses yuck!)

I sat down at a table for two (it's hard to have friends being a vegan ya know!) and looked at the menu as the waiter came over.

I was ready to ask my question, "Is this Wagyu Ribeye made from Soy?" The waiter looked at me incredulously and said "No, it's cow."

"As in moo moo cow?" I asked. He replied "Yes, moo moo, with a bell cow!"

I said "Ok, let's just start out with ice tea ... no animal in that right?" "none," my waiter assured me as he walked away (very professionally I might add!)

I frantically searched on my phone "Vegan food at stakehouse" (Apparently I meant vegan food at steakhouse) and it recommended me to order sides. Soon my waiter came back with my ice tea (Lipton, my fave!!!)

I said "Alright, I'll have a side" and the waiter was shocked "An *entire* side?!" he said, "We don't do those portions!" I looked at him again "A fraction of a side?" and he said "yes, quite a small fraction ... like 1/300th"

My smart phone searching had failed me. My waiter, visibly disappointed, said "I shall bring some bread" and left. Dear lord what have I got myself into?!

I looked over the menu again ... oh "SIDES!" It was a topic on the menu ... brussels sprouts, mushrooms, yes I know these rabbit foods, I can make a meal here after all!

I hatched a plan and he came back. I ordered a few vegetables and then he said "ok and the main course?" Dear lord, that was the main course, "I'm a vegan, I don't feed myself adequately", I screamed (well in my head, I don't have the energy in my diet to actually scream). I replied "Well let's start with those" and then hopefully he'd just forget about it and go away.

And you know what? The food was fine. Not awesome, not even particularly visible in the dim light, but fine nonetheless. Then as I had dreaded, he came back and asked "And for the main course?"

Damn it, what a classy memory he has. I coyly said "no just the check" and he said "but monsieur, that is not food" so I said "ok, another ice tea" and he departed again.

This was awful, what on earth was I going to ... I spotted what, another person sitting alone across the room ... alright, I need to go over so I did. "Hello, um hello, uh yeah hi, sorry for disturbing you. You come here often? No? Good! I'm in a predicament, you see, I'm a (whispering) I'm a vegan, and the waiter won't let me go without ordering meat ... can you come over to my table and order your food with me like you think you know me?!"

This wacky request was really all I could come up with to stave off that crazy waiter. Much to my surprise the stranger said "Don't worry I got you!" and came over to my table.

Just then the waiter came back and exasperated "Sacrebleu! You have made a friend! Who may I say this is?!"

The stranger ordered kobe beef and the waiter said "But monsieur, it is a moo moo cow!" and to which my new friend replied "yes, I sure hope so!" The waiter bombastically said "aho-ho-ho, we will do this well!"

"Oh thank god!", I sighed

I had never had a non-vegan friend before but we've been dating for 6 months. Who would have ever imagined falling in love with a vegan at stakehouse (I mean steakhouse)!
