Ok so I know this sounds crazy but hear me out.

Earlier tonight I met this guy who approached me at the parking lot of my
office in Santa Monica and claimed he was me from the future, traveling back in
time to give me something.

He said there's a very important thing I have to have and gave me a key and an
address for a safety deposit box.

Of course I said I didn't believe him and was not going to accept his gift.
Besides I don't think he even looked like me.

He tried to convince me he was me and gave me this picture and said "put this
picture on Facebook, everyone will know that it's you from the future".

I asked him how I could contact him later to follow up and he said the
timespace distortion window only allowed him to reach me for about 15 minutes,
on this night, January 20, 2019.

He said the box is under my business partner's name. I said I didn't have a
business partner and he held my hands together and looked at me in the eyes
whispering "things are changing soon. Don't expect it or it won't happen."

He then walked off the lot, saying he had to go to a very exact location to
return. I wanted to follow but I didn't think I could trust him. This could
have been an elaborate robbery. After all, this sounds completely crazy.

His last words were "Not doing this will be our only true regret."

I drove to the address in Culver City with the supposed deposit box with the
key. I wanted to see if his story actually held up.

As I approached the address I didn't see a building there at all. I didn't see
anything.

It was an empty lot with a fence on it and a sign that said "Future home of
Chase Bank opening 2020".

Anyway here's the picture of the guy. He said it would become obvious to me
after I posted this so I hope you guys can help me clear it up
