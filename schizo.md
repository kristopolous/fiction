Sometimes in my dreams someone will ask a question to a roomful of people. I'll
have no idea what the answer is and someone else will answer.

Then when I wake up I remember the answer and I go check it on the internet.

See everyone in the dream is in my head. If the answer is correct and I didn't
know it then the imagined person somehow still got it right which means I knew
the answer, didn't think I did, and was only able to access it through a
personification in a dream.

The question last night was "what happened last weekend" and the right answer
was "first day of spring". Which I honestly had to look up.

The first day of spring was on Saturday.

This is really bizarre. I wish I had access to these imagined people that I
know are smarter than me all day long.

I'd steal their answers and never give them credit. Who'd believe me anyway?
