I saw Trump on TV today when I realized that nobody watches TV news anymore.
Perhaps the only people watching were me and the guy in the control room at the
station.

Then I realized how impossible this was because I didn't own a TV. I looked
around me and the room had changed, the TV was a different size and a different
brand. This was a dream. I had taken that course in lucid dreaming. This was
the first time it worked.

I remembered I was in the middle of something important and it probably wasn't
an appropriate time to be dreaming. Not appropriate to be sleeping. So I woke
up.

I woke and saw I was still on the 10 freeway in my car on the side of the road,
overturned in the middle of the night between Arizona and California.

Then I remembered I took the 40 instead to go through Flagstaff. This detail
was so unimportant. I was in an accident but I had opened my car door and
rolled out on to the dark open expense of highway.

I don't remember at first why I got back into the car after I rolled out. I
just knew it was cold and I had no reception on my phone. Even upside down it
was still the best shelter I could find.

The box of crackers i was eating had spilled to the roof. I shared it with the
ants who had come by.

I wondered when sunrise was and went back to sleep thinking "What's that silly
Trump going to say in my dreams next?"
