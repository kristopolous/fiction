If I ever rent a property, I'll place this clause deep in the agreement:

Rent MUST be tendered in small bills, placed carelessly in a burlap bag knotted
at the top by twine and having a large black dollar sign insignia painted on
the outside. When delivered, the renter MUST be wearing a black and white
horizontally striped shirt, black slacks, leather gloves, a wide brimmed black
hat and black dress shoes. Bag MUST be delivered by exaggerated tip-toes and
placed securely in the northernmost dumpster behind the building no earlier
than 1 AM and no later than 5 AM within THREE days of the first of the month.
After delivery, renter MUST vigorously rub hands together for no less than TWO
but no greater than FOUR seconds followed by a deep gluttonous, but not hardy,
guffaw of laughter. A rental discount of up to TEN percent MAY be awarded for
strict adherence and vigorous execution.
