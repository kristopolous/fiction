I've long held that if I ever had a time machine I'd go back to the 1800s and
change the labor slogans.

There was a fight for the 8-hour workday, for instance. 8-hours of free time, 8
of labor and 8 of sleep.

I'd do 6 of work, 8 of free, 10 of sleep.

Then there was the weekend, because their holy scriptures called for a day of
rest. Because there was Jewish presence, they got both Saturday and Sunday. I'd
get a bunch of Muslims in there as well since their major day off is Friday and
bam, 3 day weekends

I'd come back to the present and a 24 hour work week would be called "full
time". My gift to humanity
