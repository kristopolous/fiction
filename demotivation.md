I'd like to be a demotivational speaker:
"Sometimes you may think life is too difficult at times or that you are in an
unlucky circumstance which you had no control over. Well I'm here to tell you,
you're right. Some people are winners, some people are losers and a lot of
times its entirely by luck. That's the way it is and you can't change it. Stop
trying. It's not going to work. It's all pointless anyway.

But don't worry, you're the only one that thinks it matters. Everyone else
forgot you existed a long time ago and they're much happier now.

You may ask 'Am I good enough? Is it worth it?' Friend, to all these questions
and more the answer is always the same 'no.' It makes no difference. Stop
trying. Give up on everything immediately. You can't do it."
