Who ever came up with the idea of gift cards is genius. Stores issuing their
own limited use currency.

How to make more money: They should float it and unpeg it from the dollar to
incentive hoarding and a trading market by limiting the supply and making each
one a collectible design. They could inject the market with new currency at
their discretion.

For instance, you could issue one for a new iPhone with the buyer paying the
price of the current new iPhone. Then the receiver may intentionally hold it
waiting for the next, greater iPhone.

Most will intentionally never be redeemed due to a perceived rise in value and
will probably be lost.

The store walks away with truckloads of cash having sold nothing but
commemorative IOU slips of paper.
