I have this idea for a twitter like system but there's a backoff period for all
posts. The idea is that the content will be more sincere and meaningful if
people couldn't just press "submit" after being flippant.

Most of the new media I see is low-effort, low-quality posts without much
thought.

People would want to engage with the system because they know everyone else is
under the same terms and what they had to say was something that they felt for
at least an hour so it wasn't just some fly-by-night scrawling of passion or
angst.

The system is that you hit reply and then later you have to look at your
"queue" and manually click "post" again or do some kind of action that further
commits you to your content.

The overarching objective is to increase the quality of conversation.
