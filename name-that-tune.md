When I was a kid I used to watch old episodes of "name that tune" where
contestants would be given clues on a piece of music and then would "auction"
off how few notes they could name the tune in.

It was always stuff I never heard of, like a Glenn Campbell song that peaked at
#34 in 1968 for a week.

The contestant, after hearing the note would excitedly claim something like "is
it Charlie bring me a luck tonight?" And host would say "why of course it is!"

Then they would play this terrible song that I could literally write from
stream of consciousness in real time and the audience would all sing along in
some Grand ceremony with the words at the bottom of the screen.

The contestant would be beside themselves in joy, they won!

It was so terrible
