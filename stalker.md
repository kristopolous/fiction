Has someone been stalking you for years; going to your grocery store, hanging
at your coffee shop...always in a way you've never noticed?

They may even be in the background of that photo from the bar 9 years ago - and
then again, as a fellow tourist in that picture you took on your honeymoon.
Again, posing as a parent during your child's christmas pagent at their school.

How did you not notice this?

Wait, they always had a camera. Look at these photos! Those were places where
everyone had a camera ... what is going on here?

No, these are just similar looking people. That's not the same person ... how
is this possible? How can someone have more time for you than you have for
yourself?

Next time you'll confront them. Ask them what they are doing there ... but what
if it isn't the same person? What if your mind is playing tricks on you and you
just harass a harmless stranger?

How will you know? What can you say to differentiate a real stranger from
someone who is lying about being one?

You go to ask your spouse but then stop and realize "what if they're in on it?"
How would you know if you could trust them... why does it even matter?

Let's forget this and pretend like it never happened.
