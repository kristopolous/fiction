Excuses must be so much more awesome in the third world:

"Sorry I'm late. The bus I was on broke down and was raided by a group of
extremists who took hostages. Luckily I escaped out the back door without being
noticed.

I was able to thumb a ride from a fruit cart to the central market in exchange
for selling a sack of apples. I was just about to sell the last one when it was
swiped from my hands by a leper so I had to pawn my wristwatch to pay for a
healer.

Then I started walking but found the bridge was flooded and collapsed by last
weeks rain so I had to swim across the stream. The current was so great that I
almost succumbed to the giant falls. I held on to a slippery rock for my life
whilst grabbing a twig to fish myself out.

Luckily a wandering gypsy found me and kindly hemmed some cloth which I wear
now.

The rest of my journey was mostly uneventful except for the government id
checks and normal bribes I had to pay.

Anyway, so here's my resume. I'm a people person and am super excited about the
position."
