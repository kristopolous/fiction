I'd like to see a skit of someone say in march talking with a friend who
studies diseases and is talking all casually

"So we gotta stay home and not go out?"
"Yeah. Everyone."
"Who's everyone?"
"Eh, yah know, like everyone everyone. All humans"
"That's crazy! For how long?"
"I dunno, 1, 2, maybe 3 years..."
"Years?!"
"Yeah, economies are gonna crash, a million or two dead...you know, global
pandemic"
"This is crazy!"
"I dunno man, we've been warning y'all about this for like 25 years. It's like
the weather guy is telling you there's a hurricane and your all still loading
up the car with flip flops and sunscreen for a beach day. The weather guy isn't
making stuff up"
"Yeah but still"
"Look, every one of us is going to be dead one day. All our children will die.
Every epitaph at a graveyard might as well read "oh, you mean me too?!" these
things will actually happen. I dunno what to tell you"
