1973: Xerox just spent 3 years and millions of dollars for top scientists to
work in secret on the next big thing.

Today, the lead scientist is demoing the fruits of their labor, the Alto, the
first modem personal computer. March, 1973:

Prof: I present, the Personal Computer!
Boss: Personal!? You mean everyone will have their own?
Prof: Yes!
Boss: In the computer room?
Prof: No, on their desk.
Boss: You want everyone to be a computer operator?
Prof: See, you drag this device around called a mouse...
Boss: Hold on, in your future, not only is everyone a data clerk but they use
strange devices?! What on Earth professor?
Prof: ...It's useful. You can send mail on it.
Boss: Oh? How?
Prof: Well the recipient's computer has...
Boss: *personal* computer? On their desk?
Prof: That's the idea...
Boss: (in disbelief) ...not in a million years. What else can it do?
Prof: You can draw on it.
Boss: A 500 pound sheet of paper! I suppose you can mail the drawings
Prof: Sure.
Boss: I'll stick with Fax machines and a pen.
Prof: This is easier!
Boss: On a computer?! *sigh* You scientists are so disconnected from reality
sometimes. (Sarcastic) I suppose you believe one day everyone will have a
personal computer in their pocket...
Prof: (excited) Oh yes! I see you're getting it!
Boss: And they'll drag their thumbs across the screen to operate it...
Prof: Yes, that is the future! Battery powered personal pocket computer
videophones on a global information network!
Boss: (impatient) Thank you for your time professor.
Prof: (not picking up the social cue) Gladly!

Prof exits.
Boss gets on phone

Boss: Oh hi Craig. Cancel the Alto project. Yes. I just got a demo from the
lead scientist. He's a delusional wacko. The fantasies he believes inâ<U+0080>¦they're
something else. He thinks everyone will communicate one day with a pocket
computer! Yes, I suppose the security guard and janitor will have one too.
(Laughs) no, I'm serious, that's project Alto. Can it.
